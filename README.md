## Boiler Fuel

Husk is purchased daily based on requirements; however, it is only available during the paddy season, so alternative arrangements are necessary at other times. Coal is sourced from traders based on quotes that consider Gross Calorific Value (GCV), moisture content, and supply shortages. Debit notes are issued if there are discrepancies in quality or shortages.

### Steps Taken

- Daily checks are conducted on husk and coal prices to ensure the best rates.
- Quotes are collected from both the direct importer and traders for comparison.
- There is only one direct importer, and all traders purchase from them under the same terms.
- Although purchasing from the direct importer incurs higher costs, a small quantity was still acquired.
- GCV analysis is performed both internally and through an external laboratory.
- It was observed that coal GCV is calculated using different methods: in Dry Basis (DB), Air-Dried Basis (ADB), and As Received Basis (ARB).
- Traders provide quotes based on ADB, whereas the direct importer quotes on ARB.
- Traders have been supplying inferior quality coal.
- The company has been issuing debit notes for minor shortages and quality issues, but they have not recognized the greater financial losses incurred due to the inferior quality.
- A system has been implemented to directly purchase husk and coal at competitive prices from the importer, eliminating the need for traders. This change has significantly reduced fuel costs for the boiler, resulting in substantial savings for the organisation.
